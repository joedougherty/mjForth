## What to do with input? ## 

All input flows through `consume_tokens`. `consume_tokens` expects a list of tokens.
(Input is first "formatted" by running it through `tokenize`.)


Example:
========

    # SOURCE: ($ROOTDIR/mjForth.py | 212)
    def consume_tokens(input_list):
        while input_list:
            term = input_list.pop(0)
            handle_term(term, input_list)


`handle_term` routes the given word to the correct action. There are a small number of possible routes:


Input Types Routing:
===================

Types of input to deal with:
    
    * Terminating Branches:

        * literals (ints, true, false)
        * Built-in words
        * word definition
        * see
        * variable declaration (in globally-accessible Memory)
        * variable store/fetch 

    * Non-terminating Branches:
    
        * do loop
        * while loop
        * User-defined words
        * conditional (IF ... ENDIF / IF ... ELSE .. ENDIF )
